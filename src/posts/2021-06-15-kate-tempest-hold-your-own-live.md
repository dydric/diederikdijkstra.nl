> When time pulls lives apart.
Hold your own.
When everything is fluid and when nothing can be known with any certainty.
Hold your own.
Hold it till you feel it there.
As dark and dense and wet as earth.
As vast and bright and sweet as air.
When all there is.
Is knowing that you feel what you are feeling.
Hold your own.
Ask your hands to know the things they hold.
I know.
The days are reeling past in squealing blasts.
Stop for breath and know it’s yours.
Swaying like an open door when storms are coming.
Hold.
Time is an onslaught.
Love is a mission.
We work for vocation until.
In remission.
We wish we’d had patience and given more time to our children.
You must feel each decision you make.
You must hold it.
Hold your own.
